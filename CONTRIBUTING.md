### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem or want to suggest a new term or use case, [search if it already exists in our issue tracker](https://github.com/TEC-Toolkit/cfkg/issues).
If a related issue does not exist, you can open a new issue here on GitHub.

### Proposing new data sources to process
1. If you'd like to suggest new data sources, please open an issue providing its metadata and download options. Make sure it has an open license!

### Contributing with a mapping
Mappings for existing open datasets are welcome. In order for your mapping to be acceptable, it should be based on a standard/well known tool, so we can reproduce it. Create your mapping in a new folder and propose your pull request (see below)

#### Make changes locally

   - Using GitHub Desktop:
     - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
     - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)!
   - Using the command line:
     - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!
